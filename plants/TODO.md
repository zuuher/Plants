# TODO List for Fixing Delete Button Issue

- [x] Update `plant_app/templates/home.html` to add a delete form for each plant card, similar to `details.html`.
- [x] Update `plant_app/templates/details.html` to display details of a single plant (remove the loop over `plants` and adjust to show the single `plant` with a delete button).
- [x] Test the application to ensure delete buttons appear and function correctly in both templates.
- [x] Run the Django server and check for any errors.
